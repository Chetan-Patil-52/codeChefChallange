# CodeChef Challenges

This repository contains solutions to various problems encountered on CodeChef. The goal is to help users understand the logic and implementation of competitive programming problems.

## Problem Statement

The code is designed to calculate the result based on the number of rounds derived from the input \( n \) and two coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). The output is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{answer} = (a \times \log_2(n)) + (b \times (\log_2(n) - 1))
\]

## Code Explanation

1. **Input**: The program takes multiple test cases, where each test case includes three integers: \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
2. **Calculation**: 
   - It calculates the number of rounds as \( \log_2(n) \).
   - Then, it computes the answer using the given formula.
3. **Output**: The result for each test case is printed.
