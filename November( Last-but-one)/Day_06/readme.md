# Code Explanation:
Input Handling:

The program first reads an integer t, which denotes the number of test cases.
For each test case, it reads six integers (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3), which represent two sets of 3 integers for Alice and Bob.
Sorting:

It creates two vectors, v1 and v2, to store Alice's and Bob's values respectively.
It sorts both vectors using sort(v1.begin(), v1.end()) and sort(v2.begin(), v2.end()). This ensures that the values are arranged in increasing order.
Score Calculation:

Alice's score is calculated as the sum of the two largest numbers from v1, i.e., v1[n-1] + v1[n-2] where n = 3. This corresponds to the two largest values in v1.
Bob's score is similarly calculated using the two largest values from v2.
Comparison:

After calculating the scores, it compares the total scores of Alice and Bob and outputs "alice", "bob", or "tie" based on who has the higher score.
Time Complexity:
Input Reading:

The input reading takes constant time per test case since it reads six integers (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3), which is O(1) for each test case.
Sorting:

The most computationally expensive operation here is sorting the two vectors of size 3 (v1 and v2). Sorting a vector of size 3 takes O(3 * log(3)) time, but since log(3) is a constant, this is effectively O(1).
Sorting two fixed-size vectors (of size 3) is therefore O(1) for each test case.
Score Calculation and Comparison:

Calculating the sum of the two largest values from the sorted vectors is constant time, O(1), since we are always picking the last two elements of a 3-element sorted vector.
The comparison between the scores is also constant time, O(1).
Overall Time Complexity:

Since sorting two vectors of size 3 is O(1) and the rest of the operations are constant time, the time complexity for each test case is O(1).
Therefore, if there are t test cases, the overall time complexity is O(t).
Space Complexity:
Input Storage:

We are using a constant amount of space for each test case: 2 vectors of size 3 (v1 and v2), and a few integer variables (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3).
Each vector of size 3 takes O(3) space, which is O(1) space per test case.
Overall Space Complexity:

Since the space used by the vectors and integers is constant, the space complexity for each test case is O(1).
Therefore, the overall space complexity for the entire program is O(1).
Conclusion:
Time Complexity: O(t), where t is the number of test cases.
Space Complexity: O(1), since the space used per test case is constant.
