# Complementary Strand in a DNA

## Problem Statement

You are given a sequence of nucleotides of one strand of DNA represented by a string `S`. The string consists of the characters `A`, `T`, `C`, and `G` only, each representing a nucleotide.

The complementary strand of DNA can be determined based on the following pairing rules:
- `A` is complementary to `T`
- `T` is complementary to `A`
- `C` is complementary to `G`
- `G` is complementary to `C`

Your task is to find and output the complementary strand for a given DNA sequence.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines:
  - The first line contains an integer `N` representing the length of the string `S`.
  - The second line contains the string `S` of length `N`.

## Output Format

For each test case, output the complementary strand of DNA.
