# Q1
##Fill Candies

Chef received \( N \) candies on his birthday and wants to distribute them into bags. Each bag has \( K \) pockets, with each pocket capable of holding at most \( M \) candies. Your task is to determine the minimum number of bags needed to store all the candies.

## Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 1000), the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three space-separated integers \( N \), \( K \), \( M \) (1 ≤ \( N, K, M \) ≤ 100).

## Output Format

- For each test case, output the minimum number of bags required.

# Q2
## Move to Target

Chef needs to move to a target position using a specific number of moves. Each move can cover a fixed distance, but there may be leftover distance that needs to be accounted for. Your task is to determine the minimum number of moves required for Chef to reach or exceed the target.

## Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 1000), the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers \( \text{target} \) and \( \text{y\_move} \) (1 ≤ \( \text{target}, \text{y\_move} \) ≤ 100).

## Output Format

- For each test case, output the minimum number of moves required.

# Q3
# Maximum Coordinate Distance

Chef wants to calculate the maximum distance between two points on a 2D plane. Each point is defined by its coordinates. Your task is to compute the maximum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points.

## Input Format

- The first line contains a single integer \( T \) (1 ≤ \( T \) ≤ 1000), the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of four space-separated integers \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) (1 ≤ \( p1, p2, p3, p4 \) ≤ 100), representing the coordinates of two points \( (p1, p2) \) and \( (p3, p4) \).

## Output Format

- For each test case, output the maximum of the absolute differences between the corresponding coordinates.
